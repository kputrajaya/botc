# Pocket Grimoire Tutorial

## Overview

Blood on the Clocktower (BOTC) is a game of murder, mystery, deduction, and deception. It's a social game with unique good and evil roles, similar to Werewolf or Mafia. The good team wins if they can execute the demon, while the evil team wins if they can wipe out the village.

Using this app, you can play BOTC _without_ physical components. The Storyteller (ST) will use one device as the Grimoire (dashboard), while the players can designate another device to display the town square. This tutorial is **targeted to the ST**.

## Setting Up

### Players and Editions

Upon opening the app, you will be prompted the **number of players** and **the edition** of the game. Currently, the app supports 5&ndash;15 players (travellers are not supported) and 4 editions:

1. [Trouble Brewing](https://botc.kvn.ovh/files/tb.pdf)
2. [Bad Moon Rising](https://botc.kvn.ovh/files/bmr.pdf)
3. [Sects & Violet](https://botc.kvn.ovh/files/sv.pdf)
4. [No Greater Joy](https://botc.kvn.ovh/files/ngj.pdf) (custom [Teensyville](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Teensyville) game for 5&ndash;6 players)

The app will then generate a list of players numbered 1&ndash;N. You should **associate these numbers** to the players. Optionally, you can click on each number to **assign an initial**, so instead of:

> 1, 2, 3, ...

you can have:

> K1, A2, R3, ...

### Role Selection

The app preselects random roles to **fulfill the required role counts**. You can use it as a baseline and adjust it to your liking. Note that the requirement is displayed on the bottom.

> **Role counts**: [Townsfolk] - [Outsider] - [Minion] - [Demon]

After selecting the roles, you should click the **"Shuffle"** button on the bottom to shuffle and assign the roles randomly to the players. Then, click the **"Share"** button to secretly share the roles with the players, in sequence.

The players will now know their roles and the game can begin.

### Town Square (Optional)

If you click the **"Town Square"** button at the top-right corner, a link will be copied to your clipboard. You can share this link with the players, so they can access the town square view.

The town square will display the players' status _in sync_ with the Grimoire, plus some other useful information.

## Running the Game

### Status

Click the status dropdown (showing "&#128516;" by default) to change player's status. This change will be reflected in the town square view.

### Tokens

Click the token dropdown (showing "&#9999;&#65039;") to add or remove tokens. Selecting a non-existing token will add it, while selecting an existing token will remove it.

Note that role-specific tokens (e.g., Monk's "Safe" token) are unique, so marking a player with it will remove the same token from another player, if any.

### Night Orders

Night orders for abilities (both first and other nights) can be accessed in an accordion on the bottom.

### Prompts

To replace physical prompts during the nights (e.g., "This is the Demon"), click the **"Prompt"** button on the bottom. It will display a list of available prompts, as well as an option to create a custom one.

Role token prompts can be used by selecting 1&ndash;3 roles to display before clicking the **"Role tokens"** button. Use this to display available roles for the Demon, role info for Washerwoman, etc.

## Ending the Game

When you wish to end the game, click the **"Reset"** button on the bottom. This will reset the app and you can start a new game.
